**1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Division**
   The term “front-end” refers to the user interface, while “back-end” means the server, application and database that work behind the scenes to deliver information to the user. The user enters a request through the interface.The front division additionally uses coding languages like html,css and javascript and it can be able to take user information and can make available to the server.The backend acts as a response and respond to all the activities done by the frontend.

   **2) What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.**
  
      HTML tags are the keywords on a web page that define how your web browser must format and display your web page. Almost all tags contain two parts, an opening, and a closing tag. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag.
      Some of the tags of the html are
      <h1>This is the header tag</h1>//This header tag ranges from h1 to h6

   **3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.**
   The virtual DOM provides a mechanism that abstracts manual DOM manipulations away from the developer, helping us to write more predictable code. It does so by comparing two render trees to determine exactly what has changed, only updating what is necessary on the actual DOM. Like React, Vue also employs this strategy.
